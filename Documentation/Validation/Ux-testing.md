# Homepage

## Logo

* As for everything, the logo is the more important content for two main reasons such as: explain what the website is about it and make the users curious to navigate around the website. 
  The logo must be super catching and for me, it is, for the style and the central position.

## More about me button

* The button has the task to make the user more curious "about it" and straight  give some interactivity to the user.

## Photos

* Like the logo, the photos play the most important part to keep the user. I implemented a lot of photos on the home page to get a super return impact from the user and keep the user to carry on to visit the website.

## Footer

* All footer contains a form request for any services that the website offer plus the owner personal contacts.
  The form has made it not too long. Is located straight in the middle with these inputs not too long and a textarea, also not too big but enough to leave an important message(in my opinion)

## Desktop view


## Colours

* The website contains a lot of grey/dark Colour on the photos and not to make everything dark and depressed 
  I decided to use a background:linear-gradient(to bottom, #f9fafb, #f8f9fa26)for the body and  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgb(255, 255, 255), rgb(146, 143, 143, 0.5))
  for the  header, for to create a big contrast between the header, the photos and the bottom where the form is located.

## Hover

* The hover pseudo-classes present are two: the first one is on the icons and the navbar, the colour that chosen is chocolate that makes a nice contrast with the default black colour. The second one is on my journey page,  passing  the mouse or fingers on the photos, I implemented on top of the dark photo an
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgb(228, 228, 228), rgba(33, 37, 41, 88%)) white colour to make a big contrast and on the same time a cool shadow (in my opinion)

# My journey

* This page is entirely dedicated to the owner experiences did by "journeys". I implemented a google map with markers and an info window to show the locations and display some information about it
  The page is divided into photos, where anyone introduces a different country. The hover effects show a button "discover more" on any photos.
  The buttons are internal links where more pictures are stored.

# Post Production

* This is the services page where there are 3 different packages named by colours and the background colour made by hover effect reflect his name.
  The packages and the prices are buttons made by the bootstrap class "border-square"
