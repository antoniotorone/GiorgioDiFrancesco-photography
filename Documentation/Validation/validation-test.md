# Validation testing

## Homepage (index.html)

* The first time I have run the html5 validation test for index.html the document came out with 1 error and 5 warnings (all of them related to the same "issue").
  The error was to not add the alt attribute on line 49 for the img tag and the 5 warnings are related to the presence of the type attribute inside the script tag.
  The error has been promptly fixed and when I have run the test for the second time, the document came out without it. I left the warning because they don't 
  damage the website functionality.

## My Journey

* The validation document for the current page came out with 5 warnings concerne the type attribute inside the script tag. Like us index.html
  I didn't take any action.

## Post production

* After the first time that I run the validation test for this page came out with 8 errors and 5 warnings(these always concerns about the type attribute inside the script tag)
  Two errors were to not add the alt attribute on line 215 and 247 for the img tag and I promptly fixed. 
  The others errors concern the p element that is not allowed as the child of elements button. I didn't fix it because in this scenario I'm using the p like as dom to call in the javascript file
  and attach an event listener that pushes some contents by the method .text

## journeymap.js

*  The test came out with warnings regarding the mozilla extension for java script. 
   I presume that is an irrelevant issue  since it does not interfere with the functionality of the web

## script.js

* The test came out with an undefined variable regarding $. I'm aware to use jquery, the jquery method does not damage the web functionality and and that is why
  I left untouched.
