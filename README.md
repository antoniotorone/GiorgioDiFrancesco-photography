### Manual Testing

#### Testing Google map

##### Expected

1.I was expected to get the map working well and smooth after opening the website after deployment.

##### Result

1. As a result, I got the error: "Api error, your site URL to be authorized". Bug showed by console [View here:] (https://res.cloudinary.com/anto8913/image/upload/v1621631707/2nd%20milestone-image/testing/result-testing-map_uheceu.jpg)

##### Fix

1. The issue was coming from the api key restriction where the URL address got after the deployment was not included. 
   I added it to the key restriction.

#### Testing Email js

##### Expected

1. After setting up all emailjs codes, the form was working very well, but as I soon copied and paste in the others website pages I was expected the same result but I failed.

##### Result

1. The result that I got was the (304) error, every time that I tried to send a request by the form.

##### Fix

1.After looking around the website and through the codes I noticed that when I copied and paste the form I didn't also paste the emailjs.init() method
   with my user id inside [View-here] (https://res.cloudinary.com/anto8913/image/upload/v1621631707/2nd%20milestone-image/testing/fix-email-js-id_ozzn40.jpg).
